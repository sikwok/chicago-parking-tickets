# Chicago Parking Tickets

This repository contains code and data that suggests the presence of implicit bias in the distribution of parking tickets in Chicago from January 2007 through May 2018.

The goal is to establish whether merely inferences from the registration details of a car in violation can lead to biased outcomes in ticketing. The project uses Ridge regression to estimate the relationship between a zip code's average ticket fine for a specified parking violation with socioeconomic data about the zip code.

The web application allows the user to choose between the zip code's demographics and the zip code's median income as an explanatory variable. The user can also choose from a list of parking violations and filter zip codes based on the number of fines that appear in the data set.
